        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Beef noodles is a noodle soup made of stewed or red braised beef, beef broth, vegetables and noodles.</p>
        <p>My favourite beef noodles however are made in Penang. Theres beef stomach included in Penang's version of beef noodles and uses koay teow for its noodles.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw beef slices</li>
            <li>Raw beef stomach</li>
            <li>Beef broth</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Koay teow noodles</li>
            <li>Chilli flakes</li>
            <li>Ground white pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Onion powder</li>
            <li>Chicken stock</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soup ingredients in a pot and simmer on low heat until the soup obtains flavor.</li>
            <li>Adjust seasoning to personal taste. I like my soup with lots of white pepper for its pepperish aromatic flavor.</li>
            <li>Add more water as needed.</li>
            <li>When the soup and the meat is done, start cooking the noodles in a separate pot.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are done, take a bowl and fill it with the soup and beef from earlier and add your noodles to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add some chilli flakes to the bowl (optional). The spiciness of the chilli flakes add a lot to the beef noodles' flavor.</li>
            <li>Add additional herbs or fried shallots to personal preference (optional).</li>
        </ol>
