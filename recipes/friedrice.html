    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like to include various toppings depending on what I prefer at the time or day.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Oyster sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper</li>
        <li>Meats/vegetables/seafood</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add some oil to a pan and heat it on low heat.</li>
        <li>Cook any meats/vegetables/seafood you want to add to your fried rice.</li>
        <li>Crack some eggs and stir fry them.</li>
        <li>Add your rice to the pan and incorporate the egg/meats/veges into the rice.</li>
        <li>Start adding the powder and sauces.</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasonings to personal taste. Sesame oil is the secret to good fried rice, but don't add too much.</li>
        <li>Once done cooking the fried rice, plate the fried rice and season the fried rice with some ground white pepper.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
